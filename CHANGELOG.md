## [Unreleased]


## [0.1.2] - 2026-06-02

### Fixed (CRITICAL)
- **macOS compilation failure** — `nix::fcntl::posix_fadvise` is restricted to `cfg(target_os = "linux")` so atomwrite now compiles on macOS arm64/Intel (the nix crate gates the symbol under `linux_android | emscripten | fuchsia | freebsd` only, breaking macOS previously)
- **`batch --transaction` rollback is now real** — pre-existing files are restored AND files newly created by `write` operations are removed. The NDJSON `rollback` event now reports `files_restored`, `files_removed`, and `total_reverted` so LLMs can verify the ACID contract. Previously files created mid-transaction were never cleaned up.
- **`replace` no longer inflates counters on jail violations** — `total_replacements` is incremented only AFTER workspace jail validation passes. Violations now emit a `JailViolation` error event with `error_class: permanent` and `retryable: false`.
- **`search` parallel events are grouped by path** — parallel walker threads no longer interleave `begin`/`match`/`end` events from different files in NDJSON output. Consumers (LLM and humans) see contiguous event sequences per file.
- **`scope --delete` Rust comments no longer leaves orphan whitespace** — prepared query for Rust comments now matches trailing whitespace so deletion produces clean code.
- **`search` invalid regex emits structured JSON envelope** — invalid patterns now fail with `AtomwriteError::InvalidInput` which propagates through `write_error_json` to stdout, not raw stderr.

### Fixed (HIGH)
- **`batch --file <PATH>` is now functional** — the flag is wired through `cmd_batch` to read the NDJSON manifest from a file (validated against workspace jail) instead of stdin only.
- **`backup --output-dir` is now respected** — the flag plumbs through `AtomicWriteOptions.backup_output_dir` to `create_backup_in`, which creates the directory if missing and prunes old backups in that directory.

### Fixed (UX)
- **Workspace jail error message corrected** — `WORKSPACE_JAIL` errors now suggest `--workspace <root>` or `ATOMWRITE_WORKSPACE=<path>` instead of the misleading "use an absolute path" (which was wrong when the path was already absolute).
- **Proptest backup retention bug fixed** — `cleanup_old_backups_in` now correctly prunes old backups when using `create_backup_in` with a custom output directory.

### Changed (Dependencies)
- `nix` updated from 0.29 to 0.31 (latest stable)
- `signal-hook` updated from 0.3 to 0.4 (latest stable)
- `windows-sys` updated from 0.59 to 0.61 (latest stable)
- `rust-i18n` updated from 3 to 4 (latest stable)
- `nix::fcntl::posix_fadvise` signature changed from `AsRawFd` to `AsFd` in 0.31 — code adapted accordingly

### Added (Agent-First Features)
- `--timeout <SECONDS>` global flag for bounded execution time (0 = no timeout, default 0)
- `--grep <REGEX>` flag on `read` to filter returned lines by regex
- `completions --install` to install completion scripts to XDG data directory (`~/.local/share/bash-completion/completions/atomwrite` for Bash, etc.)

### Security
- `cargo audit` baseline 1 vulnerability acknowledged: `RUSTSEC-2026-0009` in `time 0.3.45` (DoS via stack exhaustion). Fix requires `time >= 0.3.47` which needs Rust 1.88. Our MSRV is 1.85, and atomwrite uses `time` only via `tracing-appender` for log timestamps — not exploitable. Tracked for MSRV bump in 0.2.0.


## [0.1.1] - 2026-06-01

### Fixed

- `create_backup` now uses `fs::copy` instead of `fs::hard_link` to prevent backup corruption when original is overwritten in-place
- Exit codes in `output.rs`, `read.rs`, `batch.rs`, and `hash.rs` moved from magic numbers to named constants in `constants.rs`
- `DETECTION_SIZE` in `binary_detect.rs` centralized to `BINARY_DETECT_SIZE` in `constants.rs`
- Six `unwrap()` calls in `edit.rs` multi-edit mode replaced with `ok_or_else` for safer error handling
- `scope.rs` thread join changed from `unwrap()` to `let _ = join()` to prevent panic propagation
- `rollback.rs` `unwrap()` replaced with descriptive `expect` message
- `# Errors` documentation added to three `output.rs` public functions returning `Result`
- Portuguese test data in `file_io.rs` replaced with English

### Added
